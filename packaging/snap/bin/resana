# SNAP env variable is used by Qt to determine we are within a sandbox
# and hence should use xdg-desktop-portal. However this is broken
# (see https://github.com/Scille/parsec-cloud/issues/702) so we bypass this
# and fallback to xdg-open which is fine given we use snap in classic mode
# (i.e. without sandbox).
